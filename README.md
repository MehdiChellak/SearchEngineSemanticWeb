project concerne web semantic, the main point is to create search engine can search a sentence with semantic way and fetch from [dbpedia](https://www.dbpedia.org/)  the links that's are revelent to the sentence.

`i eat apple`  the search sould return back as result links's apple as fruit not apple company.
`my favourite color is orange` here should return back the result as color not orange fruit.
on the other hand standard google search engine doesn't support search by meaning.
